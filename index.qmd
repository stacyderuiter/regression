# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is a collection of notes on multiple regression models, generalized
linear models, mixed-effects models, generalized estimating equations,
and generalized additive models. They were originally developed for
teaching the courses STAT 245 and DATA 545 at Calvin University.

They are a work in progress. If you have questions, please [reach
